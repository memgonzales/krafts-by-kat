The minimum criteria for a pull request to be accepted and merged are as follows:
- The code changes should be inspected by a developer.
- It should not result in merge conflicts (per the test run by Github).
- It should not involve the disclosure of sensitive information (per the test run by <a href = "https://www.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian</a>). 
- It should pass all the automated unit tests set in place by the developers.

***In the event of a pull request failing the third criterion, the steps to be taken are outlined in Part 4 of the [Repository Guidelines</a>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2j9fJXZhsOGueIhA-M15-NI1kC95bYn/view?usp=sharing).***
